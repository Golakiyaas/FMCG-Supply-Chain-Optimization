## 📋 **Problem Statement**

AtliQ Mart, based in Gujarat, India, operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, and plans to expand into metro cities within the next two years. The company faces a significant challenge: key customers did not renew annual contracts due to delayed and incomplete deliveries. To tackle these issues before expansion, AtliQ Mart's management requested the analysis of their supply chain data.

The main objective is to monitor and improve:

- ✅ **On-Time Delivery (OT) %**
- 📦 **In-Full Delivery (IF) %**
- 📈 **On-Time In Full (OTIF) %**
